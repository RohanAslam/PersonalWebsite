          <h1>Thinking Process</h1>

          <p>
            For this project, I settled on covering the Wikipedia page regarding
            Association Football or “Soccer”. Below I have mapped the content
            present to a node-link diagram to show the existing Information
            Architecture of the page. Furthermore, within the IA I have
            identified and labelled the different sorts of navigation found on a
            page such as Structural, Associative and Utility. Below is the
            existing IA:
          </p>

          <img src="images/wikiExIA.png" alt="Information Architecture Image" />

          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            Moreover, the task for this part of the assignment was to create a
            revised IA with concepts covered in class. Below is the new IA that
            I have designed:
          </p>

          <img
            src="images/wikiNewIA.png"
            alt="Information Architecture Image"
          />

          <p>
            Testing and Process: The changes I brought to the IA were heavily
            influenced by usability and improving the overall user experience.
            To begin, I noted down points of focus mentioned in class and
            readings that I should use for my IA and Wireframe. These points are
            noted below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Create a simple yet resourceful design that does not overwhelm
              users with options but allows them access to many things at their
              fingertips.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>Who will be using the website, and what are their goals?</li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Simplify, not complicate, categories. If the same options are
              present under different titles, find a way to streamline or
              combine them.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Think of the business aspect. Presenting options such as "Donate"
              or "Contact Us" properly to the user to help the business side as
              well.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Move things where they should be. If a crucial option is hidden
              within categories, move it to a more seen area.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Keep space. Assume the information on the website will only grow.
              Therefore, scalability must be considered.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Moreover, for testing, I explored the website and tried to find
            things I could improve upon. This was done by entering the website
            through pages other than the homepage. Also, I tried to complete
            tasks such as creating citations, printing and exporting, searching
            for articles and logging in and out to find any gaps I could fill. I
            looked for things that even I was having trouble with. By doing
            this, I identified poor designs, which I changed within the new IA
            and wireframe.
          </p>

          <h1>Changes</h1>

          <p>
            Within the Structural (Local) Navigation of the Initial IA, the
            "Talk" and "Read" options were redundant as they refer to the same
            page. Therefore within my new IA, I removed the "Read" option and
            added a "Cite this Page" option which was previously hidden within
            Structural (Global) Navigation. The Utility Navigation, which is
            present at the top right of the screen, previously had a talk option
            which was present again right beneath it in the Structural (Local)
            Navigation. Therefore, I removed it from the Utility navigation and
            added a help option which was under the contribute category in the
            Structural (Global) Navigation before. Structural and order changes
            were also made to the Structural (Global) Navigation, where some
            important options were at the bottom instead of the top. Options
            such as "Random Article" were presented at the top when they did not
            need to be. During testing, I found myself scrolling down for
            specific options, so I decided to focus on bringing them to the top.
            I moved the "Contribute" and "Tools" options up the order as these
            are essential for anyone wanting to contribute. The "About Wiki"
            option was also brought up so anyone new to the site can have access
            and learn about the cause. The "Donate" and "Contact Us" options
            were moved two spots down but remained in the middle due to the
            importance of the business and marketing aspect of the website.
          </p>

          <h1>Wireframes</h1>

          <p>
            For the Wireframe, I created three pages for desktop and three
            corresponding pages for mobile. The wireframes were created with
            information gathered through the planning and Information
            Architecture stages. All media presented within the wireframes was
            produced using techniques learned in class, such as depth of field,
            rule of thirds and screen direction. The logo on the wireframe was
            also created by myself using adobe illustrator.
          </p>

          <h1>Desktop Wireframe</h1>

          <h2>Main Page</h2>
          <img src="images/wikiWireframe1.png" alt="Wireframe Image" />

          <h2>Article Page</h2>
          <img src="images/wikiWireframe2.png" alt="Wireframe Image" />

          <h2>Contact Us Page</h2>
          <img src="images/wikiWireframe3.png" alt="Wireframe Image" />

          <h1>Mobile Wireframe</h1>

          <div class="wireframe-container">
            <div class="wireframe">
              <h2>Main Page</h2>
              <img src="images/wikiWireframe1.1.png" alt="Wireframe Image" />
            </div>

            <div class="wireframe">
              <h2>Article Page</h2>
              <img src="images/wikiWireframe2.2.png" alt="Wireframe Image" />
            </div>

            <div class="wireframe">
              <h2>Contact Us Page</h2>
              <img src="images/wikiWireframe3.3.png" alt="Wireframe Image" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <h1>Process</h1>

          <p>
            Initially, I thought about everything that makes a wireframe the
            best it can be. For this, I went on some websites that I personally
            love the interface of, such as Apple, Airbnb and Netflix. Then, I
            looked at things that these websites do well and noted them down
            along with concepts that I thought should be applied within my
            wireframe:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Many users may enter the site from somewhere other than the main
              page. So, the concept of front doors is crucial, and we should
              leave an option for homepage access on every screen.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Optimize the website for the type of people that will use it and
              their goals.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Simplifying the interface so new users easily find everything they
              are looking for.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Maintaining efficiency by presenting options such as "Cite this
              Page" at the forefront, so the users do not have to look into
              different categories to find a tool they need.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Titles and headers are present so the user knows what they may
              find when digging through or looking in categories and options.
            </li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Protect the user's view by making down drop option for the mobile
              version so that the article is not hidden.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All these points were used when making the wireframe to ensure user
            usability and experience.
            <br />
            In conclusion, I was able to analyze a large website and remake it
            with usability as a focus. I took an existing Information
            Architecture and made changes to it with concepts and theories
            learned so far within the course. I was then able to visualize and
            present my changes through a node-link diagram and wireframes
            compromised of original media production, content production and
            design.
