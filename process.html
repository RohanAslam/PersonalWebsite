        <h1>Thinking Process</h1>

        <p>
          The thinking process regarding my website involved deciding on its
          layout, colour scheme, and content, as well as choosing or creating
          the graphics and images to be used on the site. Below I have provided
          insight into my thinking for each part:
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <ol>
          <li>
            Layout: The layout of my website has to do with the way content is
            displayed on the page. A good layout helps visitors access the most
            important parts of the website in the easiest ways. Therefore I
            included global navigation on each page, focusing on the principle
            of front doors. Layout elements on my website consisted of headers
            and footers.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            Colour scheme: The colour scheme of a website is the colours used
            throughout the website. I realized that different colours could
            influence different emotions, so it was important to have an
            appropriate yet visually appealing colour scheme that complements
            the website. I went for a more vintage and calm look for my website
            with beige and teal colours.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            Content: The content of a website is the information on a website
            that a visitor can read and has access to. This can include text,
            images, and videos. For my website, the content present is spotlight
            images on each page with a welcoming message. Image gallery on work
            page showcasing my abilities. Also, text and headings provide a
            description for each page or section. I tried to keep the content
            well-written and organized to make it easy for visitors to
            understand.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            Graphics and images: Graphics and images are a huge part of my
            website. They are used in a connotative manner to draw user
            attention. I applied in course concepts such as dutch angle, as well
            as software such as photoshop to create and edit the images present
            on my site.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I took design inspiration from websites as well. I wanted a simplistic
          look to my website due to the concept of minimizing information access
          costs. Personal websites such as
          <a href="https://www.natsaiaudrey.co.uk/" target="_blank"
            >Natsai Audrey's</a
          >
          were great help in guiding my design process. I presented links and
          other clickable components with hover features to apply the concept of
          redundancy gain.
        </p>

        <h1>Design Process</h1>

        <p>
          Within the design process I focused on creating a Information
          Architecture and wireframes, which are detailed plans for the
          structure and layout of my website. This step helped me you organize
          and plan out the navigation and flow of my website.
        </p>

        <p>
          My information Architecture (IA) creates a clear hierarchy of
          information, with the most important information appearing at the top
          levels and more specific or detailed information appearing lower down,
          effectively applying the concept of top-down processing. In addition,
          my IA details my global navigation system that users use to move
          between different pages and sections of my website. Lastly, precise
          and descriptive headings, titles, and labels help users understand the
          content on the site. Below is my IA:
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, I also developed a wireframe as it is an integral part of
          the website design process because it allowed me to represent and
          develop ideas regarding a website's structure and layout visually.
          <br />
          <br />
          It also helped me plan and organize the content to ensure all
          necessary elements were included. Below is my wireframe created based
          on the homepage of my website. The design of pages on the rest of the
          website stems from this primary wireframe.

        <h1>Acessibility</h1>

        <p>
          WCAG 2.0 are a set of guidelines that ensure web accessibility. The
          following are some measures I took to ensure that my website complies
          with these guidelines:
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <ol>
          <li>
            Provided text alternatives for non-text content, such as images with
            descriptions or alt text within HTML. By doing this, users with
            impairments can still perceive content.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            Used precise and descriptive language in the website content while
            providing clear headings and labels for links and buttons.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            Made display legible by keeping contrast between background and text
            passed standards. The different combinations can be checked
